# Systematic

This is a work in progress (currently a work in *stasis*) created for an independent study. We were interested in exploring the possibilities of teaching distributed systems algorithms in a well-typed purely functional environment. This library is the groundwork for some future experimentation in that space. The file `Design.md` is a writeup intended for an audience not particularly literate in Haskell, but relatively literate in network programming; it describes a lot of the design of the library.
